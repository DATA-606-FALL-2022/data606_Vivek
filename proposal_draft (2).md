## Project Title - "BUSINESS ANAYLSIS AND FUTURE BUSINESS PREDICTION"

___________________________________________________________________________

## Overview

#### 1. What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?

Business Analysis & Future Business Prediction is an estimate of future
developments in business such as sales, expenditures, and profits. Given the wide
swings in economic activity and the drastic effects these fluctuations can have on
profit margins; it is not surprising that business forecasting has emerged as one of
the most important aspects of corporate planning. Forecasting has become an
invaluable tool for businesspeople to anticipate economic trends and prepare
themselves either to benefit from or to counteract them. If, for instance,
businesspeople envision an economic downturn, they can cut back on their
inventories, production quotas, and hiring’s. If, on the contrary, an economic boom
seems probable, those same businesspeople can take necessary measures to attain
the maximum benefit from it. Good business forecasts can help business owners and
managers adapt to a changing economy.

#### 2. Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?

Financial planning is the cornerstone of every business’s continued success. The
process of allocating funds and determining how to best use those funds to achieve
both short- and long-term business objectives is vital and powerful.
One of the key elements in the planning cycle is the need for accurate forecasting
not always an easy task. In fact, there are some serious pitfalls that commonly
prevent companies of all maturity levels from accomplishing good forecasting and
thereby realizing sound, strategic financial planning.
1. Organizational Misalignment
2. Financial Forecasting Inefficiencies and Lack of Data Credibility
3. Operational Data Issues
4. Cumbersome Financial Consolidation
5. Difficulty With Translating Foreign Currency


#### 3. Where do you get the data to analyze and help answer your questions (creditability of source, quality of data, size of data, attributes of data. etc.)?

The data has been taken from an ecommerce website and data consist of 10 columns and basically holds the values like ship date, ID, unit price profit, country. As data size is large so I might take around 5K records to display. Data is not at all clean as it has many null and irregular values.

#### 4. What will be your unit of analysis (for example, patient, organization, or country)? Roughly how many units (observations) do you expect to analyze?

Technical analysis is applicable to stocks, indices, commodities, futures or any
tradable instrument where the price is influenced by the forces of supply and
demand. Price refers to any combination of the open, high, low, or close for a given
security over a specific time frame. The time frame can be based on intraday (1-
minute, 5-minutes, 10-minutes, 15-minutes, 30-minutes or hourly), daily, weekly or
monthly price data and last a few hours or many years. In addition, some technical
analysts include volume or open interest figures with their study of price action.

#### 5. What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis (variables should be tied to the questions in #3)?

No questions in the mind regarding the project but trying to get good accuracy and this can be done by training more dataset into the systems to make the model more and more accurate but again resources becomes a hindrance in the path.

#### 6. What kinds of techniques/models do you plan to use (for example, clustering, NLP, ARIMA, etc.)?

Regression is one of the most popular statistical technique which estimates
the relationship between variables. It models the relationship between a
dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It analyzes
how the value of dependent variable changes on changingg the values of
independent variables in the modeled relation.

The ARIMA model predicts a given time series based on its own past
values. It can be used for any nonseasonal series of numbers that exhibits
patterns and is not a series of random events. For example, sales data from
a clothing store would be a time series because it was collected over a
period of time.

Random Forest Trees are based on a number of prediction trees that are
less tolerant to noise compared to “Adaboost” and utilize random selection
of features in splitting the trees.

Prophet provides us with two models(however, newer models can be
written or extended according to specific requirements). One is
the logistic growth model and the other one is piece-wise linear model.

#### 7. How do you plan to develop/apply ML and how you evaluate/compare the performance of the models?

Using Random Forests for prediction has many advantages such as their
immunity to overfitting, an appropriate selection of randomness type leads
to accurate classification or regression, the correlation and strength of
predictors makes a good estimate of the ability for prediction, faster than
boosting and bagging, better estimation of internal errors, not complicated,
and can perform well in parallel processing. Based on the empirical results
in , Random Forests could compete with similar approaches in terms of
accuracy. Moreover,  Random Forest could give
better results with “Boosting” and “Bagging” .

#### 8. What outcomes do you intend to achieve (better understanding of problems, tools to help solve problems, predictive analytics with practicle applications, etc)?

In the narrow sense, the goal of forecasting is to produce better forecasts. But
in the broader sense, the objective is to improve organizational performance—more
revenue, more profit, increased customer satisfaction. Better forecasts, by
themselves, are of no inherent value if those forecasts are ignored by
management or otherwise not used to improve organizational performance.
 The objective of analysis is to forecast the direction of the future price. By
focusing on price and only price, technical analysis represents a direct approach.
Fundamentalists are concerned with why the price is what it is. For technicians, the
why portion of the equation is too broad and many times the fundamental reasons
given are highly suspect.

The goal is to go beyond knowing what has happened to providing a best assessment
of what will happen in the future.The scope in the field of business analytics is ever
expanding and is helping it become mainstream as companies of all sizes and
analytics skill levels get into the big data game.Exploring business anssslytics needs
the right focus, right technology, right people, right culture and top management
commitment. Companies like IBM, Accenture, and Deloitte are using business
analytics tools and coming up with decisions that are useful and profitable.
